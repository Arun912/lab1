# Review:
Project Detail:

  Thus from lab1 I created a sample server using the Express JS module in the Node JS which is a server side programming and then 
  I have processed the simple GET method in lab1.
  
  
  In lab2 I have created a local server which runs on the local machine and processing the JSON file created readily in the module, 
  which is useful for GET operations and the POST operations is also done for getting information from client and with the help of
  REST plugin we can give the operations to be performed.

Project Summary:

  Thus from LAB1 and LAB2 I have gained some of the concepts of working with the server-side programming, also the PORTS, Express
  modules basics and how we can manipulate the JSON file sormat as a form of client-side and server-side.
